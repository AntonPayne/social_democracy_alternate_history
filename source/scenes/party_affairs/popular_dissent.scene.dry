The SPD enjoys considerable support within the urban working class as well as the intelligentsia. We can use this popularity to organize a peaceful demonstration to further our political agenda. Alternatively, we can test our forces in battle against the far-right and communists, although such actions are highly illegal.

- @peaceful: Organize a peaceful demonstration.
- @violent: Wreak havoc throughout the streets!

Our event organizers and senior party members have rallied our supporters for a demonstration outside the *Tiergarten*. What is the slogan for this protest?

- @women: German women, organize!
- @democracy: Democracy dies in darkness!
# - @pacifism: The time for war is over!
# - @class_war: Crush the bourgeoisie!

@women
on-arrival: womens_rights += 1; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent)

Our advocacy for women's rights is especially popular amongst younger women, who enthusiastically attend our demonstration.

[? if spd_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]

@democracy
on-arrival: democratization += 1; pro_republic += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 2*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent)

Our party members defend the republican system and condemn the authoritarians who threaten it.

[? if democratization < 3 : Our demonstration is not as massive as originally hoped. Talk of democracy does not excite the workers as much as more practical issues. ?]
[? if democratization >= 3 : Our demonstration is attended by a large crowd!  Since we have consistently made democratization a theme of our campaign, the workers are enthusiastic about our message. ?]

Our battle-worthy units within the Reichsbanner can pick up fights with our enemies. Who are we fighting against this time?

- @far_left: The communist RFB.
- @far_right: The fascist Stahlhelm and Nazi SA.
# - @bougies: The bourgeoise activists, who abandoned us in the fight against fascism.

The RFB manages to overpower our forces! The communists celebrate their victory against the 'social fascists' while our Reichsbanner units realize how ill-prepared they are for actual combat.

@left_l
on-arrival: workers_spd += 3; workers_kpd -= 3; rb_militancy += 0.05; rfb_militancy += 0.01

Our forces defeat the communists! A furious Ernst ThÃ¤lmann is investigating the reasons for the RFB's defeat against the 'social fascists' while our Reichsbanner celebrates its hard-fought victory.

The combined forces of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA defeated the Reichsbanner! Many in the Reichsbanner are discourage by these results, and thus quit. However, the remainder are toughened as a result. Our confrontations also provide ample recruiting material for the far-right paramilitaries. 

@right_l
on-arrival: sh_strength += 10; sa_strength += 15; sh_militancy += 0.01; sa_militancy += 0.01; rb_militancy += 0.05

Our forces defeat the reactionaries! The reactionaries recruit off their dead martyrs while our Reichsbanner celebrates its hard-fought victory.
